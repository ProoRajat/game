## Assignment 2
In this assignment I modify game.c to improve gameplay and user experience.

The following features were added:

- Score: Tracks the player’s performance during the game.
- Difficulty level: Allows players to choose between different challenge levels.
- Lives: Introduces a life system, giving players multiple chances before the game ends.
- Start menu: Provides a user-friendly entry point to begin the game, select difficulty, or exit.
