In this assignment I modify game.c to improve gameplay and user experience.

The following features were added:

- Score: Tracks the player’s performance during the game.
- Difficulty level: Allows players to choose between different challenge levels.
- Lives: Introduces a life system, giving players multiple chances before the game ends.
- Start menu: Provides a user-friendly entry point to begin the game, select difficulty, or exit.

## Assignment 3
In this assignment, a Tic-Tac-Toe game was created using the C programming language.

The game runs in the terminal.

Players can compete against a computer opponent.

The board updates dynamically after each move, and win/draw conditions are checked automatically.

## Compile and Run
Compiling
Open the terminal in the project directory and run:
``` bash
gcc game.c -o game
gcc tictactoe.c -o tictactoe
```
Running
Execute the compiled programs with:
```bash
./game
./tictactoe
```
